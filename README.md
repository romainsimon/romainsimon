# Hey, I'm Romain Simon

📧 I am the founder and former CTO of [Datananas](https://www.datananas.com), a sales engagement SaaS I started in 2014 and which [acquired by Sarbacane](https://www.sarbacane.com/datananas) in 2020.

🌱 In 2021, I left Datananas and started building [Beanvest](https://beanvest.com), an investment portfolio SaaS.

🌎 In 2022, I decided to take a year off to travel around the world until 2023.


You can learn more about me on my website [https://www.romainsimon.net](https://www.romainsimon.net)

## Favorite tech stack

I often like to learn new things, but Javascript rules. My favorite tech stack for building SaaS is **Node.js** + **Vue.js** + **MongoDB**.

I really love using **Tailwind CSS** with **Tailwind UI** ❤️
